                <p>This process journal is created to highlight the progress made during this semester's DesCom core unit <b>DECO2200</b> Interaction Design Studio. Throughout the semester I have documented what has been done by writing brief paragraphs describing what I learned from tutorials as well what progress has been made towards the assignments. I decided to structure the journal in this way, by merging all the weekly progress, instead of having it in weekly chunks, this way the overall flow is improved and it should be easier to read and understand.</p>

                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <p>In the first weeks tutorial, we did two sketching exercises. We designed doors with the goal of accommodating as many different people and scenarios as possible. In the second scenario we sketched various microwaves for children, where the goal was to make it easy to use and understand and safe, with the focus on buttons.
                  This tutorial made me learn to think in a broader sense, thinking in different perspectives and learn about the different details you got to account for when the spectre of users are as broad as possible.
                </p>

                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <p> Katja Forbes’ tutorial was one of the most helpful tutorials to me. Although, nothing that she talked about was completely new to me, it really helped me brush of my knowledge and get a better understanding of design process and methods.
                </p>

                <h4>Week 3</h4>
                <p>Hendrik Muller’s tutorial was very helpful. Muller talked about research process and had some really good tips on how to not only reach your user group, but understand them and from that choosing the most beneficial research methods. In retrospect, I wish that this tutorial was earlier than week 4, because we were already close to finishing our research.

                <h4>Week 4</h4>

                            <div class="row">
                              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p> James Hunter held a tutorial on IOT and talked about how nowadays people tend to design something fancy and put the word “smart” in front of the name, even if the product is far from “smart” nor has any business becoming “smart”. He referred to these designs as “The internet of shit”.
                  He taught us the term anthropomorphism which means giving human-like attributes to animals or objects. We drew everyday house objects and gave them life by giving it a persona; demographic, needs & frustrations and solutions.

                <h4>Week 5</h4>
                <p> In this tutorial held by Stephanie Grace we learned more about design considerations and just like week 1, we designed with specific guidelines. We made storyboards and other sketches to a scenario about an autonomous taxi taking a passenger from point A to point B with an accident halfway. Again, these exercises are great, because it is great practice in considering all possible outcomes/situations in what would normally be a straight forward scenario.

                <h4>Week 6,7,8 & 9 </h4>
                <p>These weeks were all spent prototyping. We learned various forms of prototyping ranging in fidelity. I most definitely picked up some neat tricks and learned where to apply which method of prototyping. We did paper prototyping and learned all the various way of drawing boxes, texts, buttons etc. In addition, multiple methods of presenting paper prototypes. We also got to brush up on our Sketch skills. Remaking Instagram pages and then use InVision to make it useable was very useful and I applied that knowledge later when making prototypes for our concepts.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>After forming our group, we quickly launched into discussion on which area of autonomy we wanted to take further. We talked about the common autonomous vehicles like cars and drones and figured out that we wanted to focus on something less mainstream.
                  We narrowed it down to 3 possible areas; snow, military and farming. Being that we come from vastly different backgrounds, we all had good individual knowledge of the different areas we could explore. After some more discussion and also some input from our tutor, we figured that farming would be the most feasible, due to the fact that doing research and testing on the two other user groups would be challenging.

            <h4>Research methods </h4>
            <p>
              Once we had chosen our area of autonomous vehicles we started to plan our research. We knew straight away that we wanted to focus on tractors as our vehicle of choice, but we still had to conduct research with an open mind.</p>
            <p>  When we were discussing our user group we originally thought that it could be just “farmers”, but after doing some initial research on current technologies and also after talking to different farmers we figured out that full-time farmers in big industry generally have a different approach to the use of tractor, especially for the autonomous features. Lower scale farmers rely on their tractor to be much more than just a machine that pulls equipment. They use tractors for everything ranging from transport to field-work. Industry farmers however, (usually) have large and often square fields and would much prefer a fully autonomous tractor like the CASE-IH tractor. </p>
            <p>  We started out creating a survey asking basic questions related to autonomous farming to get a general understanding of what our user group already know and what they don’t. Secondly, we wanted to find out our user groups habits and if they see autonomy as viable and feasible. We sent the survey to people we knew had experience in farming and also to people who just had interest in the subject. We also attempted to share it with various farming forums, but few were willing to complete the survey.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h6>My research questions was:</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>What is the potential of autonomous farming?</li>
                  <li>What is our user group’s current knowledge of autonomous farming?</li>
                  <li>What kinds of farming can effectively be tended to with autonomous technology?</li>
                  <li>Is there a difference in interest between younger and older farmers?</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>


            <p>  The survey only had 16 responses, but they we’re all from people with experience and/or knowledge. From it, we gathered data on our user groups habits, knowledge and some preferences.</p>
            <p>  In the second part of our research, we conducted interviews. We figured that the best way of gaining insight is to talk to the farmers that potentially want to invest in our area of autonomy. For me, having grown up in a small village in Norway, getting to farmers wasn’t the hardest part. I conducted two thorough interviews with two experienced farmers through FaceTime and also had 3 more casual interviews with some other farmers, so I could get their thoughts on certain questions raised in the two other interviews. From this, I gathered really good data that completely changed my ideas and thoughts towards our future concept.</p>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>From the research, my group and I put together a list of main motivations and features that our user group meant to be crucial. As well as obstacles and concerns.
                </p>
                <h5>Main motivations</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><h6>Tractor can’t be a dedicated autonomous vehicle. It needs to be a traditional tractor with the feature of autonomous takeover</h6></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Being the fact that our target group, because of economic reasons, only can own one tractor. This tractor has a wide use far beyond what being done in the field, therefore autonomous takeover should remain a feature instead of its entire cause
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                  <li><h6>The ability to watch live feed of both front and back view</h6></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>There's a lot to monitor and keep track on when driving in the field. Interviewees expressed that an overview of the situation and the ability to make sure everything is running smoothly is critical.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><h6>The ability to do a complete calibration</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A common motivation was to have the ability of a complete calibration in preparation of the current task it is assigned. For example, the ability to choose the driving pattern, each task conducted in the field has a different approach, sometimes a linear driving pattern is ideal, other times a more circular pattern. What they seem to want is basically the complete overview and control of what’s about to happen.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><h6>Detailed monitoring</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A non-surprising motivation. It is important for farmers to make sure everything is going perfectly, as their produce relies on it. A way to monitor and keep track of statistics (as well as the live feed) is one of the most important motivations. Things like time left, fuel usage, visualisations and other values are all mentioned by the interviewees.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Concerns and Obstacles</h5>

                    <ul>
                    <li><h6>Overcoming the fear of leaving their crop in the hands of an autonomous tractor</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Especially common amongst the older farmers, some trust has to be won as their not really convinced about the technology. Farmers take pride in their produce, so I would classify this as the main concern.  </p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><h6>Automatic gear</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to the various challenges in terrain and the weight it has to pull or lift, all standard tractors today has manual gear change. One concern was made about how exactly an autonomous feature could work around manual gear change. </p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><h6>Product price and costs</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Part time and hobby farmers might not have the capital or the motivation to spend it. The purchase of a brand new
                      tractor with new technological features is a major investment and if farming is just a hobby or a very tiny percentage of your overall income, the decision can be hard.

With some additional feedback from other tutors we came up with two additional concepts; the drone and the rover. </p>

Due to our group having different schedules we decided to refine one concept each. This allowed us to be more efficient and get more done. I took on the drone concept and began by drawing a quick journey outlining how the concept would function (3.3). This gave me a good understanding of each step so I could always go back and ask myself if what I was working on next made sense.  </p>

                <p>Building on the journey I put together some rough pages with some sketches and key features (3.4). I knew from experience that you can measure growth and the “state” of the crop by looking at the factors density, colour and curvature. If you take wheat as an example, you can tell when it is ready to harvest by the way the way the weight of the corn makes in hang in a certain curve, along with the colour it is clear when it is ready. The problem about this is that you can have patches that are ready and others that aren’t. This would become the main feature of the surveying drone, by measuring said factors and providing the user with all the necessary statistics presented in a clear visual way. Because we had done little research into these type of drones, we weren’t certain what technologies could be feasible. We eventually found out that heat mapping, lidar and 3D scans are in fact feasible and actually is on the market today. Further, we wanted to create briefings for the user so that he wasn’t bound to analyze the statistics himself, but instead have a system that can summarize and present the data in a clear way.

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>Testing would prove to be a bit of a challenge for our group. As farmers aren’t the most accessible group of people in inner Sydney, we were forced to narrow our criteria and also test with people that only had connections to farming through either experience or knowledge. We ended up gathering 8 participants in various places and did testing with our 3 concepts. </p>
                <p>First iterations were made after first round of usability testing using a paper prototype. At the time, concept was incomplete and perceived as vague. Main menu was made a little more organized and added the additional pages “daily brief” and “fly”. In the flying/surveying page, options to deploy/land manually were included as well as camera monitoring. Basically developing further on all pages with the feedback I got. </p>

                </div>


                <p>Further expanding on all pages. In the flying/surveying page, more camera options were added, as well as a map that displays the location of the drone in real time. In the statistics page, window of harvest-time were added and explained to users in testing (in the blank space). Settings page will also have a full set-up and drone configurations. All fairly basic and logic iteration as a result from both testing and further development of concept.

                </div>

                  <p>After testing and further development the last iterations were made to the wireframes for concept #2. Visualized in figure 3.7 is the updated storyboard and also the one submitted as part of task 2. In figure 3.8 is all the last iterations made listed out. From this, the concept became far more feasible than I thought it would be when I started it. I think that is a good thing and also evidence that the design process was successful. </p>

                <p>This concludes the concept development stage. It was a long and tedious process, it was definitely difficult to come up with original concepts that would have an actual purpose, not only in our own user group, but for autonomy in general. It was difficult to find people to test with and even though we did, they were scattered around and we were unable to carry out testing with a gathering and we instead had to run multiple tests with one or two people at the time. Testers were also often confused, because the unfinished product didn’t always “make sense” even when told to focus on certain aspects.  </p>
                <p>Although tedious, the process has definitely been interesting and I have learned a lot. Interaction design can be particularly annoying to iterate on due to multiple reasons, one being the fact that I felt biased on what interface should look like, I suppose because I have a subconscious on what my personal ideal interface looks like.

                  <h3>Research</h3>
                  <p> Our goal of the initial research was to gain a fundamental understanding of what our user group already know of autonomous agriculture and what they don’t. We created a survey asking basic questions related to our chosen field and also other general questions in order to gain insight into who our user group actually was and their habits. We also wanted to find out if they saw autonomy to be a feasible technology in the context of farming.
                  </p>
                  <p>We conducted interviews with multiple farmers, both domestic and overseas. As it proved difficult to reach farmers within Sydney, we also expanded our user group to hobby farmers and interested individuals.
                  </p>
                  <p>As a result of research we put together an extensive list of motivations, pains and gains outlining what our user group thought to be the most important were they to use an autonomous tractor. We would constantly look back to this list whilst designing features and other aspects of our tractor.

                              <p> After completing our initial research we went on to developing concepts. Feedback from tutors suggested that we should broaden our scope and come up with some concepts for other vehicles than the tractor. For the purpose of this page, only the AXLE tractor will be covered. See the process journal page for more detailed information.
                                </p>

                              <p>In the concept development phase we initially brainstormed multiple ideas of other concepts than the tractor, that we were already fixated on. As mentioned, we developed two other concepts that can be read about in the process journal. Moving on with the tractor we already had various sketches and ideas of features, because we were already motivated towards this concept. In addition, because we based our research on tractors we also had a good mental image on what would and what wouldn’t work.

                            <span class="img-caption">Users testing various wireframes and protypes </span>

                            <p>In the testing phase we showed our participants various wireframes from all concepts, had them test certain features and generally gain their understanding on how the overall flow of things was perceived. As a result from usability testing, we made certain changed to our wireframes. The hexagon menu wheels were made a little smaller as well as the option to minimize them to free up more space for content. We wanted a high contrast color scheme as it our users spend a lot of time outside and certain factors like sunlight can affect how details of our app would stick out. We chose red and black as it has a high contrast and good aesthetics. </p>

                        <p>Over the 13 week long process we, as a group, went through the entire design process from ideation to a functioning high-fidelity prototype. This was a highly educational process as normally assignments only cover parts of the design process. We ran into multiple problems, but overcame them and learned from them. I believe I grew both as a designer and as a member of a team.
